# WTF is an Exoplanet?

An exoplanet is a planet, like Earth, but outside our solar system, probably in another one. Although asteroids are definately good targets for resources, so our planets like Earth. They're larger and more stable mining platforms ... assuming they're environment isn't like Venus which is so hot it can liquifiy lead.

We'll leave out details of travelling via [Warp Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_drive) or [cryo sleep](https://medicalfuturist.com/are-you-going-to-wake-up-from-cryosleep/) using [Cryo Chambers](https://www.cryochamberlabel.com/artist/sabled-sun/) aboard slow spaceships.

## Downloading Exoplanet Data

NSAS has an [exoplanet archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/intro.html) with public data sets of a ton of these things. We'll snag a subset of good mineral rich candidates and save to a CSV file to parse later.
